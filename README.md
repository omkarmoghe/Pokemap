# PRs - please follow the [Android style guides & best practices](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html)
## All PRs should go to the `dev` branch. `master` will be updated periodically with stable(ish) releases.

## [TODO](https://slack-files.com/T1TQY34KE-F1TSY25UL-10400392c2)
Please read through the main repo to see how the Python code is grabbing the spawned Pokemon, etc. We need to recreate that functionality in Java :D.

Also please read this: https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongodev/comments/4svl1o/guide_to_pokemon_go_server_responses/

#[Official Website] (https://jz6.github.io/PoGoMap/#)
Live visualization of all pokemon (with option to show gyms and pokestops) in your area. This is a proof of concept that we can load all nearby pokemon given a location. Currently runs on a Flask server displaying a Google Map with markers on it.

Using this software is against the ToS and can get you banned. Use at your own risk.
