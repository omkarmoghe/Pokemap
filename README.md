### Logcat

Don't know how to get a logcat? No worries!

To get a logcat you need ADB installed on your PC. You can grab that [here](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=48915118#post48915118). Be sure to type 'y' for both prompts when installing ADB. Next, you’ll need to enable USB debugging on your device. You'll find the option in different locations depending on which version of Android you have:

 * Android 3.2 and older: Settings > Applications > Development
 * Android 4.0 and 4.1: Settings > Developer Options
 * Android 4.2 and newer: Settings > About Phone (tap seven times on Build Number), then Settings > Developer Options.
 
Once you have both ADB installed on your computer and ADB enabled on your phone, it's to record a logcat. You can do so by plugging your phone into your PC then opening the command prompt (Win + R and type in cmd) and typing in the following:

`cd Desktop`

`adb logcat -d > logcat.txt`

Your logcat will be on your desktop. 

Simply upload it to some file sharing website and attatch it to your bug report.
